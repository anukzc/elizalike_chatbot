This project was for a Computational Linguistics course. From the provided skeleton code, I finished implementing a chatbot inspired by ELIZA. With my updates, the program uses regular expressions to handle personal deixis for all 1st and 2nd person subject pronouns, as well as all forms of the verb be. I implemented keyword recognition in user input that either prompts a predetermined response or a response that retains a part of the input. The action depends on the keyword that the user input.
